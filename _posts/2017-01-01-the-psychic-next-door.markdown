excerpt: Rachel Vaughn is being hunted by something… unexplainable. And it might have something to do with Luc, the handsome and mysterious guy who lives next door.

---

After her boyfriend cheats on her, Rachel Vaughn needs a fresh start. She finds it in a new apartment and despite having some seriously weird neighbours, she quickly settles into her new home. But soon after, strange things start happening. Small things start to go missing, she hears voices at night, and once&hellip; once&hellip; once Rachel swore she heard a _growl_.

Though her friend Polly fears Rachel may be losing her mind, it soon becomes clear that Rachel is being hunted by something&hellip; unexplainable. And she can't help but think it has something to do with Luc, the handsome and mysterious guy who lives next door.

Eerie, thrilling, and romantic, The Psychic Next Door twists, turns, and tortures you until its heart-stopping climax.
